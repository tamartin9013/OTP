Main function contains menu options to choose to encrypt or decrypt. Takes a message from user input and then the user can choose between encrypt or decrypt. 
When encryption is chosen, a random key is generated, and the plaintext is encrypted. 
When decryption is chosen, the program asks for the decryption key from the user and the ciphertext is decrypted.
